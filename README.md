# Overview
In this project, a CI/CD Pipeline is built which included a Python Web Application using Flask and sklearn and deployed it using Azure App Services. 
A pre trained, sklearn model has been trained to predict the housing prices in Boston according to several features, such as average rooms in a home, data about highway access, teacher-to-pupil ratio, and so on.
